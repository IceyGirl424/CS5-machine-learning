    "# Homework 1\n",

    "**Due Date**: 2/9/25 by 8pm on Canvas\n",

    "In this homework assignment, you are going to write a contact book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that the contacts book follows this general pattern: `{contact_name: (phone_number, [extra_info])}`\n",
    "\n",
    "This contact book requires the use of multiple Python data structures (list, dictionary, tuple). The outer structure is a dictionary. We will use the name of the contact as the key. For the value, we will use a tuple, where the first element is a string containing the phone number of the contact, while the second value is a list of extraneous information. This could be their email address, home address, birthday, a second phone number, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our contact book has four different features: **update**, **search**, **remove**, and **display**. You are welcome to work on these features in whichever order you wish.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can work on this by yourself or with one other person in the class. If you are working as a group, only one person needs to submit the assignment on Canvas, but make sure to write who you worked with as a submission comment!"

    "We need a function that is able to add a new contact or update existing information in the contact book. There are various scenarios to consider here.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, start by asking the user to enter the name of the contact. If that contact does not exist, then you'll need the user to enter the phone number. You will also need to ask the user if they wish to enter additional information about that contact. Allow the user to enter as much additional information as they want by using a loop. Once all the information has been gathered, store this into the contact book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another scenario occurs when the contact already exists. If that's the case, you'll need to ask the user which information they want to update. This could be the phone number, but it could also be one of the additional pieces of information they previously entered. Or, they might want to enter new additional information! You will need to handle these various scenarios."
